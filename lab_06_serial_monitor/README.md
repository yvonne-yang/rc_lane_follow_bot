# Lab 6 Serial Monitor

Python application to visualize incoming images from serial port.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 with PIP.

## Installation

The recommended method is to install in a virtualenv with `venv`.

### Generate executable

These steps are only necessary if you want to generate an `.exe` file to run the application.
You may skip these steps if you want to run the serial monitor directly from source code.
